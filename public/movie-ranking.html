<h3>Iron Man (2008)</h3>
<p>
  A billionaire industrialist and genius inventor, Tony Stark (Robert Downey
  Jr.), is conducting weapons tests overseas, but terrorists kidnap him to force
  him to build a devastating weapon. Instead, he builds an armored suit and
  upends his captors. Returning to America, Stark refines the suit and uses it
  to combat crime and terrorism.

<h3>The Social Network (2010)</h3>
<p>
  In 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer genius Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse
  Eisenberg) begins work on a new concept that eventually turns into the global
  social network known as Facebook. Six years later, he is one of the youngest
  billionaires ever, but Zuckerberg finds that his unprecedented success leads
  to both personal and legal complications when he ends up on the receiving end
  of two lawsuits, one involving his former friend (Andrew Garfield).

<h3>Avatar (2009)</h3>
<p>
  On the lush alien world of Pandora live the Na'vi, beings who appear primitive
  but are highly evolved. Because the planet's environment is poisonous,
  human/Na'vi hybrids, called Avatars, must link to human minds to allow for
  free movement on Pandora. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paralyzed former
  Marine, becomes mobile again through one such Avatar and falls in love with a
  Na'vi woman (Zoe Saldana). As a bond with her grows, he is drawn into a battle
  for the survival of her world.
